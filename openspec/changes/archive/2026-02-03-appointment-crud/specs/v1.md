# Specs: Appointment CRUD

## Requirements
1.  **Delete**:
    -   Must ask for confirmation ("Tem certeza?").
    -   On success, remove event from calendar immediately.
2.  **Edit**:
    -   Must be able to change multiple fields at once.
    -   Logic: Simplest approach is to use a specific "Edit" modal, or repopulate the "Create" modal with existing data and an ID.

## API Schema
### Update Body
```json
{
  "patient_name": "...",
  "patient_phone": "...",
  "datetime": "ISO-8601",
  "service": "..."
}
```
