## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Enhanced Availability Verification
The system verification script SHALL be able to check availability for specific dates and assert correct responses.

#### Scenario: Slot Collision
- **WHEN** an appointment is created for "2024-12-25 10:00"
- **THEN** a subsequent request for the same slot returns "taken" or "not available"

#### Scenario: Invalid Date
- **WHEN** a date is requested in "DD/MM/YYYY" format (instead of ISO)
- **THEN** agent/tool handles it gracefully or asks for correction (tool specific)

### Requirement: Dashboard API Verification
The system SHALL expose an endpoint that correctly reflects database state.

#### Scenario: API Reflects DB
- **WHEN** an appointment is inserted into SQLite
- **THEN** `GET /api/appointments` includes this appointment with correct status

### Requirement: Manual Dashboard Validation
The user SHALL have a checklist to verify frontend behavior.

#### Scenario: Create via UI
- **WHEN** user uses "Nova Consulta" modal
- **THEN** a toast "Agendamento criado" appears AND the slot becomes unavailable in backend
